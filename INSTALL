How to use the cmake build system
---------------------------------

Make a directory for the cmake build files to go into:

    sc3-plugins/$ mkdir build && cd build

    sc3-plugins/build/$ cmake ..

It assumes you have the supercollider header include files located in:
/usr/include/SuperCollider/

If you have them in another location:

    sc3-plugins/build/$ cmake -DSC_PATH=/usr/local/include/SuperCollider/ ..

or:

    sc3-plugins/build/$ cmake -DSC_PATH=/path/to/sc3source/ ..

and then:

    sc3-plugins/build/$ make

    sc3-plugins/build/$ make install

On OSX, the plugins will end up in sc3-plugins/build_osx. Copy everything inside
that folder into /Library/Application Support/SuperCollider/Extensions (or
alternatively into a user specific ~/Library folder).

--------
Options:
--------

- To set the install target: (default on linux '/usr/local')

    sc3-plugins/build/$ cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr/local ..

- Build the plugins as quarks: (default 'OFF')

    sc3-plugins/build/$ cmake -DQUARKS=ON ..

- Build supernova-plugins: (default 'OFF')

    sc3-plugins/build/$ cmake -DSUPERNOVA=ON ..

- Build AYUGens: (default 'OFF')

    sc3-plugins/build/$ cmake -AY=ON ..

To print all cmake options:

    sc3-plugins/build/$ cmake -L ..

Starting over:
--------------

If something went wrong and you want to start from scratch, delete everything
in the build directory that you made:

    sc3-plugins/build/$ make uninstall (only if you did `make install' before)
    sc3-plugins/build/$ rm -r *
